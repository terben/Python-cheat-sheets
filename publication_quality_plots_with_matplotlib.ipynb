    "To create good, informative graphics for scientific publications is a very broad and complex topic. My experience is that many authors of scientific articles obviously invest a lot of time on the text but seem to have spent only very little time to create, finetune or homogenise their figures. The graphics often seem to be close to the first output of whatever the authors plotting software shows them. The graphics of all plotting programs in their default configurations are optimised to show reasonable results *on the screen*. However, this does not lead to good results within a publication document. In fact, graphics that are optimised for a written document do not make a good first impression *on the screen*  - see also below. \n",
